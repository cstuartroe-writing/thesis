  abstract  = {Semantically detailed and typologically-informed morphological analysis that is broadly applicable cross-linguistically has the potential to improve many NLP applications, including machine translation, n-gram language models, information extraction, and co-reference resolution. In this paper, we present a universal morphological feature schema, which is a set of features that represent the finest distinctions in meaning that are expressed by inflectional morphology across languages. We first present the schema's guiding theoretical principles, construction methodology, and contents. We then present a method of measuring cross-linguistic variability in the semantic distinctions conveyed by inflectional morphology along the multiple dimensions spanned by the schema. This method relies on representing inflected wordforms from many languages in our universal feature space, and then testing for agreement across multiple aligned translations of pivot words in a parallel corpus (the Bible). The results of this method are used to assess the effectiveness of cross-linguistic projection of a multilingual consensus of these fine-grained morphological features, both within and across language families. We find high cross-linguistic agreement for a diverse range of semantic dimensions expressed by inflectional morphology.},

The first task evolves past years{'} inflection tasks by examining transfer of morphological inflection knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource language. This year also presents a new second challenge on lemmatization and morphological feature analysis in context. All submissions featured a neural component and built on either this year{'}s strong baselines or highly ranked systems from previous years{'} shared tasks. Every participating team improved in accuracy over the baselines for the inflection task (though not Levenshtein distance), and every team in the contextual analysis task improved on both state-of-the-art neural and non-neural baselines.},
