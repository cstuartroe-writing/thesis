This thesis would not have been possible without the feedback of my student readers Tessa Pham and Anya Capps and my second faculty readers Amanda Payne and Steven Lindell, nor without the guidance of Sorelle Friedler, professor of the Haverford Computer Science department's thesis seminar, but most of all it has been enabled by the continued support and guidance of my advisor, Jane Chandlee.
